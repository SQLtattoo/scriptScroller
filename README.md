## 🚀 Quick Start (For Developers)

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14 or higher)

### Installation

```powershell
npm install
```

### Run the App

```powershell
npm start
```

### Build Installers

Create platform-specific installers for distribution:

```powershell
npm run make
```

This will create installers in the `out/make/` directory:
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer (Squirrel)
- **macOS**: `.zip` archive (requires building on macOS)
- **Linux**: `.deb` and `.rpm` packages (requires building on Linux)

**Note:** Due to platform limitations, each OS installer must be built on its native platform. For convenience, we use GitHub Actions to build all platforms automatically when you push a version tag.

### Create a Release (Automated Build for All Platforms)

To build installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux automatically:

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Commit your changes
3. Create and push a version tag:

```powershell
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

GitHub Actions will automatically build installers for all platforms and create a release with downloadable assets.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Launch** the app with `npm start`
2. **Paste** your script in the text area
3. **Adjust** speed and font size to your preference
4. **Click** "Start Scrolling"
5. **Position** the window right below your webcam for natural eye contact
6. **Resize** the window to make it narrow and tall for better camera alignment
7. **Press Space** to start scrolling - it begins automatically!

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Space** | Play/Pause scrolling |
| **S** | Slow down to stop (smooth deceleration) |
| **↑/↓** | Increase/Decrease speed (±0.3 increments) |
| **R** | Reset to beginning |
| **F** | Toggle fullscreen |
| **Esc** | Show controls / Exit to setup |

**Note:** Arrow keys allow fine-grained speed control from 0.1 (very slow) to 10.0 (very fast).

## 🎥 Pro Tips for Video Recording

- **Window Positioning**: Place it directly below your camera lens so your eyes naturally look toward the camera
- **Narrow & Tall**: Resize the window to be narrow and tall - this creates less eye movement left-to-right
- **Font Size**: Larger fonts work better when the window is further from the camera
- **Speed**: Start slow and gradually increase as you get comfortable
- **Deceleration**: Press **S** for a smooth slowdown instead of an abrupt pause
- **Practice**: Run through your script a few times to find your ideal speed

## 💾 State Persistence

Script Scroller automatically saves your work:
- **Script content** - Your text is preserved between sessions
- **Window size & position** - Opens exactly where you left it
- **Settings** - Font size and scroll speed are remembered

The app always starts on the setup screen, ready for you to review or edit your script before scrolling.
