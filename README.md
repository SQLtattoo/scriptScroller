## 🎥 Pro Tips for Video Recording

- **Window Positioning**: Place it directly below your camera lens so your eyes naturally look toward the camera
- **Narrow & Tall**: Resize the window to be narrow and tall - this creates less eye movement left-to-right
- **Font Size**: Larger fonts work better when the window is further from the camera
- **Speed**: Start slow and gradually increase as you get comfortable
- **Practice**: Run through your script a few times to find your ideal speed
